hla-mapper: https://github.com/erickcastelli/hla-mapper

(What is it? What does it do?)
(input data: BAM or CRAM with unmapped sequences. FASTQ files.)


It is version 4.5.1 (Aug 2024). The `hla-mapper dna --type` is not working well in this version.

So just do remapping with **hla-mapper** (`hla-mapper dna`) and use **hla-genotyping** to obtain HLA data.
