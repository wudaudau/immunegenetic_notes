# IMMUNEGENETIC NOTES

This repository contains structured notes for learning tools and analysis steps in studying immunegenetic genes.

There are many immune genes. Due to theire property and gene structure, specific method are require to study them correctly. For example

The notes focus on HLA-related work.

## Obtaining HLA data

We focus on two main data source: 1) genotyping array data and 2) WGS data.

- HLA imputation: impute HLA variants (alleles, amino acids, and SNPs) from the genotying array data. We need QC steps in prior to the imputation.
- HLA calling: extract HLA from WGS data.
