# IMMUNEGENETIC NOTES

I am learning tools and analysis steps study the HLA genes. I try to organize my notes in a structured way.

There are two main parts:

- HLA imputation: impute HLA variants (alleles, amino acids, and SNPs) from the genotying array data. We need QC steps in prior to the imputation.
- HLA calling: extract HLA from WGS data.
